# PhantaC_Engine
Personal engine

Since course projects are so rushed, I've decided to pursue a small game engine that will help me better understand C++ concepts. My passion projects allow me the opportunity to implement inheritance, OOP, abstraction, and different programming ideas, so I'm hoping that this project allows me critical learning opportunities that will benefit my programming career and any organizations where I am employed.

Things I plan on implementing:
- Rendering (of course)
- Multi-threading
- Collision
- Artificial game intelligence
- Mouse & Keyboard support
- XBox controller support
- Data structures
- Design patterns

Things to learn from:
- Think about const correctness from the beginning
- Planning saves time in the long run
